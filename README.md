# AML-3104---Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-
This repository belongs to the DSSM AML 3104.  This repository contains the group project.

# The Task
The Challenge is to build a Deep learning model and code to count the number of Capuchinbird calls within a given clip. 

# About Dataset

The Data is split into Training and Testing Data. For Training Data we have provided enough clips to get a decent model but you can also find, parse, augment and use additional audio clips to improve your model performance.

# Training Sets
- Parsed_Capuchinbird_Clips - Folder of audio clips which has Capuchin birds audio clip
- Parsed_Not_Capuchinbird_Clips - Folder of audio clips which does not have Capuchin birds audio clip

# Testing Set
- Forest Recordings - Folder of audio clips to predict count of bird calls in (Your Goal to Predict)
